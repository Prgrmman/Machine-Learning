All scripts are implemented in python 3


Project Deliverables:

A presentation in class on the problem, approach, and results (May 2 and 4). 25% of your project grade.
A paper describing your work (Due May 2). 25% of your project grade.
Code and scripts (Due May 2). 25% of your project grade.

Final Project Report Instructions:
 
The final paper should have the usual structure of a scientific paper:
The paper should begin with an abstract, which should be no longer than two paragraphs describing what problem you are addressing and what your discoveries were.
The paper should have an opening introduction section that describes the motivation, the problem you are addressing, and your approach to solving the problem.
The middle of the paper should describe your technical contribution in detail. The middle may be broken up into multiple sections, for example one describing an algorithmic approach and another describing experimental setup and results.
Your paper must include a section that discusses prior work: research that studies related problems, or the same problem you are addressing, other approaches that are related to your technical approach that may or may not have been applied to the same type of application, or foundational mathematical or scientific ideas you are building on.
The paper should end with a conclusion that summarizes your contributions and discusses open problems that remain.
Lastly, your paper should end with a list of references.
As part of the final project report, you will need to describe each person's contributions to the project.
