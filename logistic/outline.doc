This report details my approach for multinational logistic regression.
My reading material can be found here:  http://www.statisticssolutions.com/mlr/

I will be looking at student performance at different levels. For the middle east data set, score is already segmented into three levels: low, medium, and high.

I will convert the Portugal data into three levels. The student score is nominal, but I will apply a low, medium, and high metric to the score.

I will run several experiments:
I will run both math and Portugal language datasets with f-test-selected features and evaluate performance
I will run both math and Portugal language datasets without f-test selected features
I will run both math and Portugal language datasets with L2 regularization.
I will run the middle east dataset with and without L2 regularization.
   

Results on the middle east dataset:
The model uses a random 2/3 splits for training and test data.
I ran the model 20 times and took an average of the model’s accuracy for different L2 penalty values. I did this by manually changing the script. My model peaked out around 76% accuracy. Here are the results of my experiments:

0.001: approx 63%
0.01: approx 66%
0.05: approx 70%
0.1: approx 74%
0.5: approx 76%
