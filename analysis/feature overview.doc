This document contains the process and methodology that I used to select features. In terms of data quality, there were no missing values and only a few outliers, so most of my work went into selection and not cleaning.

I made two base assumptions when doing my selection. First, I assumed that the features were independent. Secondly, I assumed a linear relationship between all features and the target G3 student scores.

My methodology was to determine the statistical significance of linear relationships between various features and student score. To do this, I used one-way ANOVA on the coefficients (weights) from the resulting linear models.
